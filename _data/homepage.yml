  title: "About the Course"
  first_paragraph: "<p>About 500K new immigrants make their way to the US every year. Despite what politicians might say, immigrants are extremely important to the US Economy. They work hard, appreciate what America has to offer, create jobs and contribute immensely to the melting pot called the United States of America.</p><p>But first they have to Adjust.</p><p>Moving to America is a big deal. There is a lot that changes - the food, the finance system you live in, the culture, the people, the socially accepted norms. Most people learn the same things over time about adjusting to the US. Most people <bold>make the same mistakes when adjusting to the US.</p> <p>No more.</p><p>My goal is to help you - the American immigrant - get smart from the first day you set foot in the US. Unlike me, I don’t want you to get this information piecemeal from co-workers, friends and strangers. I want you to be ready to adjust when you move here the first day, and avoid some of the mistakes I have made. My friends have made. My relatives have made. </p><p>While there is a lot to teach, I am going to begin with one of the most impactful areas; that of personal finance. This course will help you understand everything you need to, to have an impactful first few years in the US:</p>"
  second_paragraph: "<p>While there is a lot to teach, I am going to begin with one of the most impactful areas; that of personal finance. This course will help you understand everything you need to, to have an impactful first few years in the US:</p><strong><p>Part 1: Basics of the US financial system</strong><br/>What are credit bureaus? Are free checking accounts really free? What is credit theft? Why do people use credit cards all the time? Understand the big picture of the US financial system, so that you don’t get lost in important conversations.</p> </p> <strong><p>Part 2: How to build your credit history</strong><br/>Without a good credit score, you cannot - rent an apartment, get a mortgage, get a car loan, get a credit card, even get a cellphone contract. So when you move to the US for the first time, how do you get on the path to building a good credit score? Understand how to progressively build a strong credit history while avoiding costly mistakes.</p> <strong><p>Part 3: Banking and Personal Finance</strong><br/>Where should you bank? How much cash should you carry? Should you use a credit card for everything? How should you invest money in the beginning? Learn how to bank and manage personal finances in the USA without - well - breaking the bank :).</p>"
