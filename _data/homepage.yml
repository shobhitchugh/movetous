  title: "About the Course"
  first_paragraph: "<p>About 500K new immigrants make their way to the US every year. Despite what politicians might say, immigrants are extremely important to the US Economy. They work hard, appreciate what America has to offer, create jobs and contribute immensely to the melting pot called the United States of America.</p><p>But first they have to adjust.</p><p>Moving to America is a big deal. There is a lot that changes - the food, the finance system you live in, the culture, the people, the socially accepted norms. Most people learn the same things over time about adjusting to the US. Most people <bold>make the same mistakes when adjusting to the US.</p> <p>No more.</p><p>My goal is to help you - the American immigrant - get smart from the first day you set foot in the US. There is a lot about America you should know. I got this information piecemeal from co-workers, friends and strangers, slowly, and over time. I want you to be ready to adjust when you move here the first day, and avoid some of the mistakes I have made. My friends have made. My relatives have made. </p>"
  second_paragraph: "<p>While there is a lot to learn, I am going to begin with one of the most impactful areas; that of personal finance. This course will help you understand everything you need to, to have an impactful first few years in the US:</p><strong><p>Part 1: Basics of the US financial system</strong><br/>What are credit bureaus? Are free checking accounts really free? What is credit theft? Why do people use credit cards all the time? Understand the big picture of the US financial system, so that you donâ€™t get lost in important conversations.</p> </p> <strong><p>Part 2: How to build your credit history</strong><br/>Without a good credit score, you cannot - rent an apartment, get a mortgage, get a car loan, get a credit card, even get a cellphone contract. So when you move to the US for the first time, how do you get on the path to building a good credit score? Understand how to progressively build a strong credit history while avoiding costly mistakes.</p> <strong><p>Part 3: Banking and Personal Finance</strong><br/>Where should you bank? How much cash should you carry? Should you use a credit card for everything? How should you invest money in the beginning? Learn how to bank and manage personal finances in the USA without - well - breaking the bank :).</p>"

    - paragraph: "<strong>It is time to get educated</strong>"
    - paragraph: "I moved to the US in 2002. I had no idea how much I did not know about the country. From driving to living, from banking to making sure I used politically accepted language, from dating to making friends - I had a LOT to learn. All this happened over several years, and I made several mistakes along the way."
    - paragraph: "Fast forward 14 years, and I am settled here with a wonderful wife who grew up here in the US, and two beautiful kids. That's us below. "

    - paragraph: "But even now, as more of my friends and family have moved to the US, they have had to learn the same things again. Some of it is adventure! And some - pure stress. So I had a dream - what if I could help new immigrants adjust faster to the US? What if my experience, and the experience of people I interview, helps everyone moving here? This is why I started ImmigrantHQ. "
    - paragraph: "One of the most impactful areas - and where I am going to start - is the financial system of this country. When I moved here, I knew people had credit cards - but had no idea what purpose they sent. I would not qualify for car loans, credit cards - even cellphones. And I thought paying any amount of interest on anything was bad!"
    - paragraph: "Move forward 14 years, and I have seen a huge number of people go through the exact same questions, the same anxieties, and face the same risks. How cool it would be if they had this knowledge from the beginning?"
    - paragraph: "Now they can. I am creating this course to impart as much of the practical knowledge that I have accumulated over the years, thanks to guidance from friends, family and relatives. But I hope you can know it from day one so you make the right decisions right now!"
    - paragraph: "As I get ready for our launch, you can up below to get your first lesson completely free."
